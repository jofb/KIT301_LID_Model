# KIT301_LID_Model
This is an example program which will load a tflite lid model and some given audio file, then infer the language from it.

To use, make sure to install all requirements, then run the file inference_tflite.py.
If you wish to use a different model or audio clip you will just need to change the directories specified down the bottom of the python file.
